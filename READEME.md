# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. This project comes with a sample project, a test for contracts, a sample script that deploys with the contract and an example of a task implementation, which lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat complete
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
